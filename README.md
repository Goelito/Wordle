# Wordle
This is a program that uses the concept of Worlde

to launch the program you need to install Colorama with this command:

pip install colorama

Then you put the Main and the list of words in the same file and you can start the program. I would send in another commit the fact that a single letter is colored if it is there only once or that 2 letters are colored if it is there twice etc.
